    "interval" is the number of days per update step (1 or 5); much other data
    depends on this so don't change except by selecting another base scenario.
    "iseed" is the random number seed. If non-zero it should ideally be a
    prime. Experiment creator tools set this for you.
    "latentp" is the duration of latent period of an infection, i.e. from
    inoculation by mosquito to the first day the infection is patent. -->
