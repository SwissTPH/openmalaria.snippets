  <!-- Diagnostics library. Usable since schema version 33. Should be placed
    following the <pharmacology> element (or <entomology> if the former is not
    used).
    
    Additionally, under <monitoring> one can specify <surveys diagnostic="NAME">
    (i.e. "diagnostic" instead of "detectionLimit") to use one of these to
    check patency in surveys. Health system and MSAT/test-and-treat diagnostics
    are specified separately.
    
    You can safely remove any diagnostics you do not use from your scenario.

  <diagnostics>
    <!-- Example with cut-off of 2.5 parasites/Î¼L measured according to the
    non-Garki (also called "other") methodology). Note that if "units" is not
    specified, it will usually default to "Other" anyway. -->
    <diagnostic name="example" units="Other">
      <deterministic minDensity="2.5"/>

    <!-- Example specified relative to Malariatherapy methodology. -->
    <diagnostic name="deterministic" units="Malariatherapy">
      <!-- this diagnostic has no basis in reality -->

    <!-- Example specified relative to the Gari measurement method. -->
    <diagnostic name="garki" units="Garki">

    <!-- Note that the measurement methodology has a big impact on sensitivity
    (effectively Garki with cut-off of 2 and non-Garki with cut-off of 40 are
    similar). -->
    
    <!-- Neonatal mortality was estimated from patency data measured using a
    specific diagnostic. The following should be used to replicate that in our
    model (though the impact of using different diagnostics is generally not
    large). Specify the diagnostic under <model>:
    <clinical healthSystemMemory="28d">
      <NeonatalMortality diagnostic="neonatal-diagnostic"/>
    </clinical>
    (optionally with different healthSystemMemory and with NonMalariaFevers
    data), and specify the diagnostic under <diagnostics> : -->
    <diagnostic name="neonatal-diagnostic" units="Other">
      <!-- detection limit 40 according to non-Garki method -->
      <deterministic minDensity="40"/>

    <!-- Some stochastic models of diagnostics, parameterised with the help of
    Alan Shapira: -->
    <diagnostic name="microscopy" units="Other">
      <stochastic dens_50="20" specificity="0.75"/>
